    description: `ENFJ are natural-born leaders, full of passion and 
    charisma. Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes
    our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring
    others to achieve and to do good in the world. With a natural confidence
    that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy 
    in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their 
    community.
    People are drawn to strong personalities, and Protagonists radiate authenticity,
    concern and altruism, unafraid to stand up and speak when they feel something needs to be said. 
    They find it natural and easy to communicate with others, especially in
    person, and their Intuitive (N) trait helps people with the Protagonist 
    personality type to reach every mind, be it through facts and logic or 
    raw emotion. Protagonists easily see people’s motivations and seemingly 
    disconnected events, and are able to bring these ideas together and 
    communicate them as a common goal with an eloquence that is nothing short
    of mesmerizing.The interest Protagonists have in others is genuine, almost to 
    a fault – when they believe in someone, they can become too involved in the
    other person’s problems, place too much trust in them. Luckily, this trust 
    tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Protagonists’ altruism and authenticity
    inspire those they care about to become better themselves. But if they aren’t
    careful, they can overextend their optimism, sometimes pushing others further
    than they’re ready or willing to go.Protagonists are vulnerable to another snare
    as well: they have a tremendous capacity for reflecting on and analyzing their own
    feelings, but if they get too caught up in another person’s plight, they can develop
    a sort of emotional hypochondria, seeing other people’s problems in themselves, 
    trying to fix something in themselves that isn’t wrong. If they get to a point 
    where they are held back by limitations someone else is experiencing, it can hinder
    Protagonists’ ability to see past the dilemma and be of any help at all. When this
    happens, it’s important for Protagonists to pull back and use that self-reflection to
    distinguish between what they really feel, and what is a separate issue that needs to
    be looked at from another perspective. `,

    of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, ENFP's are less interested 
    in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and
    emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate,
    the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd. More than just 
    sociable people-pleasers though, ENFP's, like all their Diplomat cousins, are shaped by their
    Intuitive (N) quality, allowing them to read between the lines with curiosity and energy.
    They tend to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is connected – but unlike Analyst
    Personality types, who tend to see that puzzle as a series of systemic machinations, 
    ENFP's see it through a prism of emotion, compassion and mysticism, and are always looking
    for a deeper meaning. Many other types are likely to find these qualities irresistible, and if 
    they’ve found a cause that sparks their imagination, ENFP's will bring an energy that oftentimes
    thrusts them into the spotlight, held up by their peers as a leader and a guru – but this isn’t
    always where independence-loving ENFP's want to be. Worse still if they find themselves beset
    by the administrative tasks and routine maintenance that can accompany a leadership position.
    ENFP's’ self-esteem is dependent on their ability to come up with original solutions, and
    they need to know that they have the freedom to be innovative – they can quickly lose patience or
    become dejected if they get trapped in a boring role.`,

    behind a common goal. However, ENTJ's are also characterized by an often ruthless level of 
    rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set
    for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest
    they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of
    the world – but we have ENTJ's to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take
    for granted every day.If there’s anything ENTJ's love, it’s a good challenge, big or small,
    and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This
    quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant ESTP's, and their ability
    to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans 
    with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is
    often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as ENTJ's push their goals through with sheer willpower 
    where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to
    push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.`,

    INFJ', thriving on the process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift
    in the wind for all to see. They don’t always do this because they are trying to achieve some deeper
    purpose or strategic goal, though. Sometimes it’s for the simple reason that it’s fun. Playing the
    devil’s INFJ' helps people with the ENTP personality type to not only develop a better sense
    of others’ reasoning, but a better understanding of opposing ideas – since ENTP's are the ones
    arguing them. This tactic shouldn’t be confused with the sort of mutual understanding Diplomat personalities
    seek – ENTP's, like all Analyst personality types, are on a constant quest for knowledge,

    popular – which makes sense, given that it is also a very common personality type, making up
    twelve percent of the population. In high school, ESFJ's are the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks,
    setting the tone, taking the spotlight and leading their teams forward to victory and fame.
    Later in life, ESFJ's continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social
    gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy.Discussing scientific theories or
    debating European politics isn’t likely to capture ESFJ's’ interest for too long. ESFJ's are
    more concerned with fashion and their appearance, their social status and the standings of other people.
    Practical matters and gossip are their bread and butter, but ESFJ's do their best to use their powers
    for good.ESFJ's are altruists, and they take seriously their responsibility to help and to do
    the right thing. Unlike their Diplomat relatives however, people with the ESFJ personality type will
    base their moral compass on established traditions and laws, upholding authority and rules,
    rather than drawing their morality from philosophy or mysticism. It’s important for ESFJ's to
    remember though, that people come from many backgrounds and perspectives, and what may seem right to
    them isn’t always an absolute truth.ESFJ's love to be of service, enjoying any role that allows them
    to participate in a meaningful way, so long as they know that they are valued and appreciated.
    This is especially apparent at home, and ESFJ's make loyal and devoted partners and parents.
    ESFJ personalities respect hierarchy, and do their best to position themselves with some authority,

    of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together.
    Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the ESTJ personality type
    are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths.
    Taking pride in bringing people together, ESTJ's often take on roles as community organizers,
    working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of
    the traditional values that hold families and communities together.Demand for such leadership is high
    in democratic societies, and forming no less than 11% of the population, it’s no wonder that many
    of America’s presidents have been ESTJ's. Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that
    must be earned, ESTJ personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty,
    and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares hard,
    manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it is ESTJ's.
    ESTJ's are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts – the surety
    of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and
    push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren’t just empty talk either,
    as ESTJ's are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans
    and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable.
    However, ESTJ's don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be
    reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates
    jeopardize them through incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show
    their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities,
    but it’s not because ESTJ's are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values
    are what make society work.`,

    to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move
    from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, ESTP' personalities
    love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, ESTP's
    volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend. Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about
    global issues and their implications don’t keep ESTP's interested for long. ESTP's keep
    their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is
    – or better yet, to just go out and do it. ESTP's leap before they look, fixing their
    mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.ESTP's
    are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and
    dive into the action – they are the eye of the storm. People with the ESTP' personality type
    enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it’s so stimulating to
    their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality
    in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response.This makes school and other highly
    organized environments a challenge for ESTP's. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart,
    and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far
    from the hands-on learning that ESTP's enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see
    this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities.    
    Also challenging is that to ESTP's, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass 
    than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school instructors
    or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and can earn ESTP personalities a certain reputation.
    But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff,
    ESTP's are a force to be reckoned with.`,

    shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high
    for the INFP personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time
    with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.Being a part of the Diplomat
    Role group, INFP's are guided by their principles, rather than by logic (Analysts), excitement
   (Explorers), or practicality (Sentinels). When deciding how to move forward, they will look to
    honor, beauty, morality and virtue – INFP's are led by the purity of their intent, not rewards and
    punishments. People who share the INFP personality type are proud of this quality, and
    rightly so, but not everyone understands the drive behind these feelings, and it can lead to
    isolation.At their best, these qualities enable INFP's to communicate deeply with others,
    easily speaking in metaphors and parables, and understanding and creating symbols to share their

    The strength of their visionary communication style lends itself well to creative works, and it

    fight tirelessly for an idea they believe in. They are decisive and strong-willed, but will rarely
    use that energy for personal gain. INFJ's will act with creativity, imagination, conviction,
    and sensitivity not to create an advantage, but to create balance. Egalitarianism and karma are
    very attractive ideas to INFJ personalities. These types tend to believe that nothing would

    description: `The ISTJ personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 
    13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless 
    dedication to duty make ISTJ's a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that 
    uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. 
    People with the ISTJ personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take 
    pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, ISTJ's hold back none of their time 
    and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.ISTJ's don’t make many 
    assumptions, preferring instead to analyze their surroundings, check their facts and arrive at practical
    courses of action. ISTJ personalities are no-nonsense, and when they’ve made a decision, 
    they will relay the facts necessary to achieve their goal, expecting others to grasp the situation immediately 
    and take action. ISTJ's have little tolerance for indecisiveness, but lose patience even more
    quickly if their chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore 
    key details – if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, ISTJ's can become noticeably angry 
    as deadlines tick nearer.When ISTJ's say they are going to get something done, they do it, 
    meeting their obligations no matter the personal cost, and they are baffled by people who don’t hold 
    their own word in the same respect. Combining laziness and dishonesty is the quickest way to get on 
    ISTJ's’ bad side. Consequently, people with the ISTJ personality type often prefer 
    to work alone, or at least have their authority clearly established by hierarchy, where they can 
    set and achieve their goals without debate or worry over other’s reliability.
    ISTJ's have sharp, fact-based minds, and prefer autonomy and self-sufficiency to reliance 
    on someone or something. Dependency on others is often seen by ISTJ's as a weakness, 
    and their passion for duty, dependability and impeccable personal integrity forbid falling into 
    such a trap.`,

    description: `ISTP's love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the 
    world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type 
    are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for 
    the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, 
    ISTP's find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting 
    them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.ISTP's explore ideas through 
    creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other 
    people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them getting into their 
    space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t interfere with ISTP's’ principles 
    and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to ISTP's returning the interest in kind.
    ISTP's enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care 
    about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. 
    Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can 
    be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.`,

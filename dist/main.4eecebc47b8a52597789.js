With a natural confidence that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community. People are drawn to strong personalities, and Protagonists radiate authenticity, concern and altruism, unafraid to stand up and speak when they feel something needs to be said. They find it natural and easy to communicate with others, especially in person, and their Intuitive (N) trait helps people with the Protagonist personality type to reach every mind, be it through facts and logic or raw emotion. Protagonists easily see people’s motivations and seemingly disconnected events, and are able to bring these ideas together and communicate them as a common goal with an eloquence that is nothing short of mesmerizing.The interest Protagonists have in others is genuine, almost to a fault – when they believe in someone, they can become too involved in the other person’s problems, place too much trust in them. Luckily, this trust tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Protagonists’ altruism and authenticity inspire those they care about to become better themselves. But if they aren’t careful, they can overextend their optimism, sometimes pushing others further than they’re ready or willing to go.Protagonists are vulnerable to another snare as well: they have a tremendous capacity for reflecting on and analyzing their own feelings, but if they get too caught up in another person’s plight, they can develop a sort of emotional hypochondria, seeing other people’s problems in themselves, trying to fix something in themselves that isn’t wrong. If they get to a point where they are held back by limitations someone else is experiencing, it can hinder Protagonists’ ability to see past the dilemma and be of any help at all. When this happens, it’s important for Protagonists to pull back and use that self-reflection to distinguish between what they really feel, and what is a separate issue that needs to be looked at from another perspective.","strength":"Tolerant | Reliable | Charismatic","weakness":"Overly Idealistic | Too Selfless | Too Sensitive"},{"id":2,"title":"ENFP","caption":"HarleyQuinn","img_s":"/ENFP_HarleyQuinn_s.jpg","img_l":"/ENFP_HarleyQuinn_l.jpg","description":"The ENFP personality is a true free spirit.

More than just sociable people-pleasers though, ENFP\'s, like all their Diplomat cousins, are shaped by their Intuitive (N) quality, allowing them to read between the lines with curiosity and energy. They tend to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is connected – but unlike Analyst Personality types, who tend to see that puzzle as a series of systemic machinations, ENFP\'s see it through a prism of emotion, compassion and mysticism, and are always looking for a deeper meaning. Many other types are likely to find these qualities irresistible, and if they’ve found a cause that sparks their imagination, ENFP\'s will bring an energy that oftentimes thrusts them into the spotlight, held up by their peers as a leader and a guru – but this isn’t always where independence-loving ENFP\'s want to be. Worse still if they find themselves beset by the administrative tasks and routine maintenance that can accompany a leadership position. ENFP\'s’ self-esteem is dependent on their ability to come up with original solutions, and they need to know that they have the freedom to be innovative – they can quickly lose patience or become dejected if they get trapped in a boring role.","strength":"Curious | Observant | Energetic and Enthusiastic","weakness":"Poor Practical Skills | Find it Difficult to Focus | Overthink Things"},{"id":3,"title":"ENTJ","caption":"Aquaman","img_s":"/ENTJ_aquaman_s.jpg","img_l":"/ENTJ_aquaman_l.jpg","description":"ENTJ\'s are natural-born leaders.

Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have ENTJ\'s to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.If there’s anything ENTJ\'s love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant ESTP\'s, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as ENTJ\'s push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.","strength":"Efficient | Energetic | Self-Confident","weakness":"Stubborn and Dominant | Intolerant | Impatient"},{"id":4,"title":"ENTP","caption":"Joker","img_s":"/ENTP_joker_s.jpg","img_l":"/ENTP_joker_l.jpg","description":"No one loves the process of mental sparring more than the ENTP personality type, as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to prove their points.

Later in life, ESFJ\'s continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy.Discussing scientific theories or debating European politics isn’t likely to capture ESFJ\'s’ interest for too long. ESFJ\'s are more concerned with fashion and their appearance, their social status and the standings of other people. Practical matters and gossip are their bread and butter, but ESFJ\'s do their best to use their powers for good.ESFJ\'s are altruists, and they take seriously their responsibility to help and to do the right thing. Unlike their Diplomat relatives however, people with the ESFJ personality type will base their moral compass on established traditions and laws, upholding authority and rules,rather than drawing their morality from philosophy or mysticism. It’s important for ESFJ\'s to remember though, that people come from many backgrounds and perspectives, and what may seem right to them isn’t always an absolute truth.ESFJ\'s love to be of service, enjoying any role that allows them to participate in a meaningful way, so long as they know that they are valued and appreciated. This is especially apparent at home, and ESFJ\'s make loyal and devoted partners and parents. ESFJ personalities respect hierarchy, and do their best to position themselves with some authority, at home and at work, which allows them to keep things clear, stable and organized for everyone.","strength":"Knowledgeable | Quick Thinkers | Original","weakness":"Insensitive | Intolerant | Very Argumentative"},{"id":6,"title":"ESTJ","caption":"Hawkman","img_s":"/ESTJ_Hawkman_s.jpg","img_l":"/ESTJ_Hawkman_l.jpg","description":"ESTJ\'s are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together.

Taking pride in bringing people together, ESTJ\'s often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.Demand for such leadership is high in democratic societies, and forming no less than 11% of the population, it’s no wonder that many of America’s presidents have been ESTJ\'s. Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that must be earned, ESTJ personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty, and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it is ESTJ\'s.  ESTJ\'s are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts – the surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren’t just empty talk either, as ESTJ\'s are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable. However, ESTJ\'s don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates jeopardize them through incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show  their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all entinel personalities, but it’s not because ESTJ\'s are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society work.","strength":"Dedicated | Strong Sense of Duty  | Direct and Honest","weakness":"Inflexible and Stubborn | Judgmental  | Difficulty Expressing Emotion"},{"id":7,"title":"ESTP","caption":"Catwoman","img_s":"/ESTP_catwoman_s.jpg","img_l":"/ESTP_catwoman_l.jpg","description":"ESTP\'s always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group.

If an audience member is asked to come on stage, ESTP\'s volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend. Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep ESTP\'s interested for long. ESTP\'s keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. ESTP\'s leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.ESTP\'s are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action – they are the eye of the storm. People with the ESTP\' personality type enjoy drama, passion and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it’s so stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response.This makes school and other highlyorganized environments a challenge for ESTP\'s. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart, and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that ESTP\'s enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities. Also challenging is that to ESTP\'s, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and can earn ESTP personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, ESTP\'s are a force to be reckoned with.","strength":"Bold | Rational and Practical | Original","weakness":"Insensitive | Impatient  | Risk-prone"},{"id":8,"title":"ESFP","caption":"Green Lantern","img_s":"/ESFP_GreenLantern_s.jpg","img_l":"/ESFP_GreenLantern_l.jpg","description":"If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the ESFP personality type.

When deciding how to move forward, they will look to honor, beauty, morality and virtue – INFP\'s are led by the purity of their intent, not rewards and punishments. People who share the INFP personality type are proud of this quality, and rightly so, but not everyone understands the drive behind these feelings, and it can lead to isolation.At their best, these qualities enable INFP\'s to communicate deeply with others, easily speaking in metaphors and parables, and understanding and creating symbols to share their ideas. Fantasy worlds in particular fascinate INFP\'s, more than any other personality type. The strength of their visionary communication style lends itself well to creative works, and it comes as no surprise that many famous INFP\'s are poets, writers and actors.

ISFJ\'s take their responsibilities personally,consistently going above and beyond, doing everything they can to exceed expectations and delight others, at work and at home.","strength":"Supportive | Reliable and Patient | Imaginative and Observant","weakness":"Humble and Shy | Take Things Too Personally | Repress Their Feelings"},{"id":14,"title":"ISFP","caption":"Zatana","img_s":"/ISFP_Zatana_s.jpg","img_l":"/ISFP_Zatana_l.jpg","description":"ISFP personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. ISFP\'s enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!”ISFP\'s live in a colorful, sensual world, inspired by connections with people and ideas. These personalities take joy in reinterpreting these connections, reinventing and experimenting with both themselves and new perspectives. No other type explores and experiments in this way more. This creates a sense of spontaneity, making ISFP\'s seem unpredictable, even to their close friends and loved ones. Despite all this, ISFP\'s are definitely Introverts, surprising their friends further when they step out of the spotlight to be by themselves to recharge. Just because they are alone though, doesn’t mean people with the ISFP personality type sit idle – they take this time for introspection, assessing their principles. Rather than dwelling on the past or the future, ISFP\'s think about who they are. They return from their cloister, transformed.ISFP\'s live to find ways to push their passions. Riskier behaviors like gambling and extreme sports are more common with this personality type than with others. Fortunately their attunement to the moment and their environment allows them to do better than most. ISFP\'s also enjoy connecting with others, and have a certain irresistible charm.","strength":"Charming | Sensitive to Others | Imaginative","weakness":"Fiercely Independent | Unpredictable | Easily Stressed"},{"id":15,"title":"ISTJ","caption":"John Stewart","img_s":"/ISTJ_John-Stewart_s.jpg","img_l":"/ISTJ_John-Stewart_l.jpg","description":"The ISTJ personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make ISTJ\'s a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the ISTJ personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, ISTJ\'s hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.ISTJ\'s don’t make many assumptions, preferring instead to analyze their surroundings, check their facts and arrive at practical courses of action. ISTJ personalities are no-nonsense, and when they’ve made a decision, they will relay the facts necessary to achieve their goal, expecting others to grasp the situation immediately and take action. ISTJ\'s have little tolerance for indecisiveness, but lose patience even more quickly if their chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore key details – if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, ISTJ\'s can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer.When ISTJ\'s say they are going to get something done, they do it, meeting their obligations no matter the personal cost, and they are baffled by people who don’t hold their own word in the same respect. Combining laziness and dishonesty is the quickest way to get on ISTJ\'s’ bad side. Consequently, people with the ISTJ personality type often prefer to work alone, or at least have their authority clearly established by hierarchy, where they can set and achieve their goals without debate or worry over other’s reliability. ISTJ\'s have sharp, fact-based minds, and prefer autonomy and self-sufficiency to reliance on someone or something. Dependency on others is often seen by ISTJ\'s as a weakness, and their passion for duty, dependability and impeccable personal integrity forbid falling into such a trap.","strength":"Honest and Direct  | Strong-willed and Dutiful | Very Responsible","weakness":"Stubborn | Insensitive | Always by the Book"},{"id":16,"title":"ISTP","caption":"John Constantine","img_s":"/ISTP_JohnConstantine_s.jpg","img_l":"/ISTP_JohnConstantine_l.jpg","description":"ISTP\'s love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, ISTP\'s find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.ISTP\'s explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them getting into their space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t interfere with ISTP\'s’ principles and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to ISTP\'s returning the interest in kind. ISTP\'s enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.","strength":"Optimistic and

Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes\n    our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring\n    others to achieve and to do good in the world. With a natural confidence\n    that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy \n    in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their \n    community.\n    People are drawn to strong personalities, and Protagonists radiate authenticity,\n    concern and altruism, unafraid to stand up and speak when they feel something needs to be said. \n    They find it natural and easy to communicate with others, especially in\n    person, and their Intuitive (N) trait helps people with the Protagonist \n    personality type to reach every mind, be it through facts and logic or \n    raw emotion. Protagonists easily see people’s motivations and seemingly \n    disconnected events, and are able to bring these ideas together and \n    communicate them as a common goal with an eloquence that is nothing short\n    of mesmerizing.The interest Protagonists have in others is genuine, almost to \n    a fault – when they believe in someone, they can become too involved in the\n    other person’s problems, place too much trust in them. Luckily, this trust \n    tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Protagonists’ altruism and authenticity\n    inspire those they care about to become better themselves. But if they aren’t\n    careful, they can overextend their optimism, sometimes pushing others further\n    than they’re ready or willing to go.Protagonists are vulnerable to another snare\n    as well: they have a tremendous capacity for reflecting on and analyzing their own\n    feelings, but if they get too caught up in another person’s plight, they can develop\n    a sort of emotional hypochondria, seeing other people’s problems in themselves, \n    trying to fix something in themselves that isn’t wrong. If they get to a point \n    where they are held back by limitations someone else is experiencing, it can hinder\n    Protagonists’ ability to see past the dilemma and be of any help at all. When this\n    happens, it’s important for Protagonists to pull back and use that self-reflection to\n    distinguish between what they really feel, and what is a separate issue that needs to\n    be looked at from another perspective.
